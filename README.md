## Project Overview
To complete the analysis of election results for the Colorado Board of Elections. 

The overall objective is to go through the election results and calculate a few metrics and write the output to the file. The metrics to be calculated are:
1. Calculating the total votes cast
2. Identifying the list of candidates for whom votes have been cast
3. Calculating the total number of votes each candidate received
4. Calculating the percentage of votes each candidate received
5. Determining the winner of the election based on popular vote

## Challenge Overview
This module helped in getting started with Python. I learned the syntax used in the language to define and create variables. I was able to apply programming concepts previously learned such as using loops, performing calculations etc. I was also introduced to file handling using Python. We were able to successfully read the election results file and store the results in a newly created file. We were also exposed to the packages available in Python and learned how to use certain functions within packages which were readily available such as the csv package to perform operations on a csv file. 

## Challenge Summary
I was able to successfully complete this challenge and calculate the winning percentage of the vote and identify the winner of the election.
